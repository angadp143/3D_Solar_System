# 3D Solar System

A visually engaging 3D representation of the Solar System built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project models the planets orbiting around the Sun, providing an interactive experience to learn about the Solar System.

## Description

The **3D Solar System** project is an educational tool designed to visually represent our Solar System in a browser. Each planet is crafted with CSS and JavaScript animations to resemble real planetary orbits and rotations. Users can explore the Solar System in a simulated 3D space, with the planets revolving around the Sun at proportional speeds, helping convey an idea of planetary motion. 

This project can be useful for students, educators, or anyone interested in space who wants to gain an introductory understanding of the Solar System's layout and dynamics.

## Project Overview

This project provides a 3D view of the Solar System where users can see planets revolving around the Sun. Each planet is displayed with proportional sizes and speeds (to a reasonable extent). JavaScript is used to create animations for the orbits, while CSS and HTML handle the layout and styling.

## Features

- Interactive 3D view of the Solar System.
- Realistic orbits and rotation speeds for each planet.
- Click on each planet to learn basic facts.
- Responsive design, suitable for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML** - Structure of the page and elements.
- **CSS** - Styling of planets, stars, and animations.
- **JavaScript** - Animation and interactivity.

## Usage

- Use your mouse to interact with the Solar System.
- Click on any planet to get details (requires JavaScript).
- Zoom in/out and explore the orbits and planets in real time.

## Future Improvements

- Add more detailed information about each planet.
- Improve realism with textures for planets and the Sun.
- Add minor planets or moons.
